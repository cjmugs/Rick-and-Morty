             <p>"Listen Morty, I hate to break it to you,
         but what people call “love” is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed.
          It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. 
          I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above.
           Focus on science."</p>

         and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world,
          I change it."</p>

           It creates infinite idiots just to eat them."</p>
